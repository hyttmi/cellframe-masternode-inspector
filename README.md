# Cellframe Masternode Inspector

**Cellframe Masternode Inspector** is a Python plugin for monitoring and managing your Cellframe masternode. It provides live system stats and cached network stats through an authenticated HTTP API. It supports multiple networks, caches data per network, offloads work to RPC nodes when possible (with automatic local fallback for wallet operations), and refreshes its cache only when the blockchain advances by a configurable number of new blocks.

---

## Features

- **Live System Stats**: Uptime, CPU/memory usage, IP, hostname, version, and more.
- **Cached Network Stats**: Block counts, chain size, block rewards, wallet balances, signing stats, token price, and moreâ€”on all supported networks.
- **Multi-Network Support**: Works with all Cellframe networks running on your node (e.g. `Backbone`, `KelVPN`, etc.).
- **Efficient Caching**: Per-network cache is refreshed only when N new blocks are detected (`block_count_threshold`), not on a timer.
- **RPC Node Offload**: Inspector fetches network data from RPC nodes for fast access. Wallet queries automatically fall back to the local node if no RPC node is available.
- **Easy Authentication**: All HTTP API requests require an access token.
- **Batch Actions**: Query multiple metrics at once.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Configure via node config or drop-in file.

---

## How It Works

- **System actions** always return live, up-to-date data directly from your node.
- **Network actions** (except `network_status` and `autocollect_status`) return cached data, which is refreshed after a configurable number of new blocks are detected (see `block_count_threshold`).
- **Wallet operations** use RPC nodes for speed, but will automatically use your local node if RPC nodes are unavailable.
- **`network_status` and `autocollect_status`** always provide live data.

## Installation

### 1. Find Your Plugin Directory

Typically:
```
/opt/cellframe-node/var/lib/plugins
```
Check your node config (`/opt/cellframe-node/etc/cellframe-node.cfg`):
```
[plugins]
enabled=true
py_load=true
py_path=../var/lib/plugins
```

### 2. Copy the Plugin

Clone and copy as root:
```bash
sudo cp -r cellframe-masternode-inspector /opt/cellframe-node/var/lib/plugins/
```
Or clone directly:
```bash
sudo git clone https://github.com/hyttmi/cellframe-masternode-inspector.git /opt/cellframe-node/var/lib/plugins/cellframe-masternode-inspector
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Use the node's Python environment:
```bash
sudo /opt/cellframe-node/python/bin/pip3 install -r /opt/cellframe-node/var/lib/plugins/cellframe-masternode-inspector/requirements.txt
```

---

## Configuration

### How to Configure

You can configure via:

- **A. Main Config File**:
  Add a `[mninspector]` section to `/opt/cellframe-node/etc/cellframe-node.cfg`.

- **B. Drop-in Config File**:
  Create `/opt/cellframe-node/etc/cellframe-node.cfg.d/mninspector.cfg` with:
  ```
  [mninspector]
  key=value
  ```

### Supported Options

| Key                     | Default | Description                                                         |
|-------------------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| access_token_entropy    | 64      | Entropy (length) of generated access token                          |
| days_cutoff             | 90      | Number of days for daily block/reward stats                         |
| block_count_threshold   | 20      | Cache is refreshed after this many new blocks are detected          |
| gzip_responses          | false   | Enable gzip compression for HTTP responses                          |
| debug                   | false   | Enable debug logging                                                |
| plugin_url              | mninspector | URL endpoint for the plugin                                    |

**Example:**
```
[mninspector]
access_token_entropy=128
days_cutoff=30
block_count_threshold=10
gzip_responses=true
debug=true
plugin_url=mninspector
```

- **Note:**
  `days_cutoff` controls days shown in daily block/reward history actions (`_daily`, `_daily_amount`, `_daily_rewards`).
  `block_count_threshold` sets how often the cache is refreshed per network.

---

## Authentication

You must authenticate every request, either by:

- **Query parameter**:
  `?access_token=YOUR_API_TOKEN`
- **Header**:
  `X-API-Key: YOUR_API_TOKEN`

Find your token in `token.txt` (auto-generated on first launch).

---

## API Usage

### Endpoint

All requests go to `/mninspector` (or your custom `plugin_url`).

### System Actions

Return live system stats.

**Example:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8079/mninspector?action=node_uptime&access_token=YOUR_API_TOKEN"
curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_TOKEN" "http://localhost:8079/mninspector?action=node_uptime"
```

### Network Actions

**Network actions must use the `network_action` parameter.**

Query stats for a specific network:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8079/mninspector?network_action=block_count&network=Backbone&access_token=YOUR_API_TOKEN"
curl "http://localhost:8079/mninspector?network_action=block_count&network=KelVPN&access_token=YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

Multiple network actions (comma-separated):
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8079/mninspector?network_action=block_count,chain_size,network_status&network=Backbone&access_token=YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

All supported networks (with per-network cache).

**Note:**
Most network actions return cached data, refreshed after `block_count_threshold` new blocks.
`network_status` and `autocollect_status` are always live.

### Batch Requests

Query multiple actions at once (comma-separated), or use `all` for all metrics.

**System Example:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8079/mninspector?action=node_uptime,node_cpu_usage,node_memory_usage&access_token=YOUR_API_TOKEN"
curl "http://localhost:8079/mninspector?action=all&access_token=YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

**Network Example:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8079/mninspector?network_action=block_count,chain_size,network_status&network=Backbone&access_token=YOUR_API_TOKEN"
curl "http://localhost:8079/mninspector?network_action=all&network=Backbone&access_token=YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```
